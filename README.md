# [K1] Canderous Final Conversation Timing Adjustment
This is a simple edit of the starting conditional script that gates off the final branch of the personal quest for Canderous. In the vanilla game, it can only be accessed when on the Unknown World, making it easy to miss, so this has been changed to any time after escaping the Leviathan.
